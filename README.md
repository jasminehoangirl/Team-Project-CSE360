## About The Project

<p> This project was developed as part of the project for CSE360 at Arizona State University. 
The objective is to design and implement a software application that allows for knowledge sharing and collaboration among students, instructors, academic staffs, and reviewers.
The system would allow for students to ask and answer questions while reviewers and instructors would provide feedback to ensure high-quality responses. 
</p>

## Key Functions include:
- **User Authentication and Password Authentication**
  - Users will be checked before allowing them to use the software through a login system.
  
- **User Roles & Permissions**
  - Users will be able to create a username and password for their log-ins and will be able to select their role.
  - Users will be able to have multiple roles (admin, student, instructor, staff, reviewer) with each role having different priviledges.

- **Question & Answer Management**
  - Users with the "Student" role will be able to post questions, browse existing ones, and receive potential answers by reviewers.

- **Review & Feedback**
  - Reviewers will be able to assess answers and students will be able to build a list of trusted reviewers.

- **Monitoring by Instructors and Staff**
  - Instructors and Staff will be able to monitor discussions, be able to respond to the discussion posts, and ensure that the discussion posts are in a positive and productive learning environment.

- **Admin Permissions**
  - Admins will be able to manage user accounts and role assignments.
